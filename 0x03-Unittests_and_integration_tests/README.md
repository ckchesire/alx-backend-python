# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

## Testing Overview

This project uses a combination of **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure both isolated logic and system-wide interactions work correctly. Unit tests focus on individual functions or components, typically using **mocking** to replace external dependencies like APIs or databases. They are fast and ideal for catching logic errors early. Integration tests, on the other hand, verify that multiple components work together as expected — such as database queries, API calls, or service coordination — and are essential for identifying communication issues between modules.

To enhance testing efficiency and readability, we use common patterns such as **fixtures**, **parametrization**, and **mocking**. Fixtures help set up and tear down reusable test environments (e.g., sample data or database connections). Parametrization allows testing multiple input-output combinations in a single function, keeping the test suite clean and comprehensive. Mocking is used in unit tests to isolate code from external systems, ensuring focused and reliable testing.
